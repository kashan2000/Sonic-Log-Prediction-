# Sonic Log Prediction

## Whaat is Sonic Log?
Sonic logging is a well logging tool that provides a formationâ€™s interval transit time, designated as {\displaystyle {\Delta }t}, which is a measure of a how fast elastic seismic compressional and shear waves travel through the formations.

I had a DataSet which contains well log data.
I used all the other Well Log data to predict the results of the Sonic Log.
This can help in reducing well logging cost. I we can predict the results of one Logging Tool with the help of others it well reduce the cost of that particular Logging tool.
I have used Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression for prediction.
Attached are the results of my Predictions.
